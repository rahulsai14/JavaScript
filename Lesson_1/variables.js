// Variables are containers for data, used to store data
// undefined - Don't know what is there
// null - We know what is there but the value is empty

// JS is a dynamically typed language - in the run it takes the data type

//Variable rules
// Variable - Only can include letters, digits, underscore and $, Spaces not allowed
//          - Should start with letter, underscore or $
//          - No keywords should be used as varibale names

// Different type of defining variables
// var - variable can be re-declared and updated, A global scope variable
// let - variable cannot be re-declared but can be updated, A block scope variable {}
// const - variable cannot be re-declared or updated, A block scope variable {}

// We use max let or const came in ES6

let name = "Rahul Sai";

console.log(name)

// const - we should intialize with a value
// let - we can declare without intialize the value
